# Line App

Line is a mobile app allows users to easily create and join virtual lines. Traditional lines can be inconvenient, uncomfortable, and even dangerous in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual lines solve these problems by allowing users to join via the app and notifying them when it is their turn.

## Progress

So far, we have developed the concept for the app and done some initial prototyping to determine the capabilities of [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com), the technologies we are planning to use. Next, we will develop requirements. After that, we will design the architecture, work on more detailed component designs, and move on to prototyping.
