# Line App

This application allows users to virtually wait in a line. In a traditional line, people must wait in a physical location until their turn, which can be inconvenient, uncomfortable, and even dangerous in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Lines occur when waiting for a seat at a restaurant, waiting for food in a cafeteria, waiting in line for COVID-19 testing or vaccines, and waiting in line at theme parks.
